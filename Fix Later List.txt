- Test player collisions, implement cancelling mob collisions
- Test what happens when a regular player quits while someone is vanished,
  and the regular player logs back in after the vanished player unvanishes.
- Silent chest opening, editable
- Stop mobs from following you if you type /v while targeted
- Redstone ore still "glows" when you step on it/click
- Hide invis players from NPCs

- Item pickup works as expected
- Entity targeting works as expected
- Silent chests are not editable, feature or bug?

- Basically need to test all of the features with a 2nd account
